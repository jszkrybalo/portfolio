# Final Project

## Part One: Project Proposal

### Rationale
As an arts management student with a theatre background, I wanted to develop a project centered around theatre. The simplest and most significant data that we gather in theatre revolve around attendance, ticket sales, and revenue. Although my personal interest is in non-profit theatre companies, there is more complete data available for commercial Broadway shows. I determined that I could likely tell an interesting story about the success of commercial arts over the past three decades that would hopefully speak to a general audience.

As I developed the story, I decided to include a final section that connects the results of commercial theatre to non-profit theatre to serve as a call to action for the audience to support the arts taking place in their own neighborhood. 

### Project Outline
This project aims to interrogate the theory that live theatre no longer has a place in modern society by identifying trends in yearly attendance and revenue for Broadway shows over the past four decades, both in New York and on tour. 
There are five main sections of the story: 

#### One: Introduction
The project will begin by hooking the intended audience with a provocative question: **Is theatre a dying artform?** One or two key images will enhance the message and help pique the interest of the audience. A very brief (two-three sentence) summary will then introduce the topic more fully and make the scope of study more clear. 

#### Two: Broadway Revenues
The next section will feature a simple data visualization showing the rise in revenues on Broadway over the past few decades. This will likely be a simple bar chart. The chart will also feature call-outs of popular productions that broke into mainstream popular culture, such as Hamilton, Wicked, and the Lion King.

Next, the same visualization will be adjusted to account for inflation. I am actually interested to see how this changes the results, whether a clear rise is still evident or the rise is almost exactly equal to inflation of the American dollar.
