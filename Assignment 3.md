# Assignment 3: Critique by Design

For this assignment, I took the easy route and Googled "terrible data viz". 

I quickly found one on WTF Visualizations that I thought would be fun to work with: 
![WTFviz](bad viz.png)

Unfortunately, I was not able to find the original article that this was created to accompany. However, I was able to find the original data set on [Stat Can](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CMACA&Code1=595&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&SearchText=ontario&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Immigration%20and%20citizenship&TABID=1&type=0).
