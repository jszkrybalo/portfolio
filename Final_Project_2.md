# Final Project

## Part Two: Wireframes and User Research

### Creating Wireframes and Storyboards

I started out by drafting wireframe versions of the major components of my data story in Tableau. I then compiled them with some of my initial sketches into a new page in my github portfolio, so that my test users could access them from there. I found this to be a relatively simple solution that achieved the "scrolling story" design I am aiming for in my final project. In the final version I plan to have more

### Intended Audience

When I thought about presenting my story to my classmates in Telling Stories with Data, I realized that the class and Heinz College as a whole represent a much sought-after demographic in theatre and the arts; well-educated younger adults with an interest in either public policy, the arts, or information systems. So while my intended audience is actually the class, in a way they also represent a larger population of potential arts audiences that I am trying to entice with my story. 

Using the class as a frame of reference, I have made some general assumptions about my audience. My audience is: 
..* Age 22-35
..* Pursuing a Master's Degree or higher
..* Living in a smaller urban center with a rich arts and cultural district
..* Interested in Public Policy (approx 60%) Arts Management (approx 20%) or Information Systems (approx 20%) 
..* Above the poverty line, with some expendable income and large potential for expendable income in just a few years after graduation

### Selecting Test Users

My selection of test users was informed by my intended audience parameters and a level of convenience. I selected three test users who I thought brought a variety of viewpoints to my work. They are:

1. **My Roommate** 
An Arts Management master's student with a background in orchestral music. She is familiar with non-profit arts organizations but not necessarily with theatre. I felt that her viewpoint, though closest to my own, would be valuable to me to make sure that my story is still compelling for someone who does come to the table with a bit more knowledge about the subject matter. She has also not taken the Telling Stories With Data class. 

2. **My girlfriend**
A MEIM student currently living in LA. Her background is in the music industry. I thought she could provide a more commercial point of view and let me know if the non-profit sections in particular were too niche or had any jargon. 

3. **My Sister**
An administrative assistant planning to pursue a Master's or PhD in microbiology. Though she is not currently enrolled in school, my sister is very well-educated and has a scientific background, which I thought would bring a more analytical viewpoint to my visualizations. 

### User Feedback Survey

I asked each test user to look through my wireframes and storyboard and answer some questions about each of the major visualizations, plus a few questions about the overall flow of the story. The questions are below: 
###### Please answer for each of the visualizations
1. In your own words, please use 1-2 sentences to state what you think the main message of this visualization is. 
2. Please rate the visualization on each of the following elements using the scale below:
1-Very Bad | 2-Poor | 3-Fair | 4-Good | 5- Excellent
  a.	Aesthetics- is it nice to look at?
  b.	Mood- do the colors and fonts suit the message?
  c.	Clarity- how easy is it to navigate and understand?
  d.	Completeness- does it seem like there’s information missing?
  e.	Intrigue- does it tell a story that interests you? 
3.	Please list any suggestions you have, or specific problem areas you’d like to see addressed:
###### Please answer for the overall story
1.	Do you think there is a story inherent in the way the data is presented? 
2.	If so, is the story easy to follow? 
3.	Do you have any other notes or recommendations about the overall flow of the piece?

### User Feedback Responses 

#### Test User 1
##### Viz #1
* The message is that overall, over the time period shown, the number of people seeing Broadway shows has increased. 
Aesthetics: 4
Mood: 4
Clarity: 4.5
Completeness: 3.5 
Intrigue: 4.5 
* I know what Broadway is but everyone might not. Does this include off-bway? Just in NY? Travelling Shows?
##### Viz #2
