# Final Project

## Part Two: Wireframes and User Research

### Creating Wireframes and Storyboards

I started out by drafting wireframe versions of the major components of my data story in Tableau. I then compiled them with some of my initial sketches into a new page in my github portfolio, so that my test users could access them from there. I found this to be a relatively simple solution that achieved the "scrolling story" design I am aiming for in my final project. In the final version I plan to have more

### Intended Audience

When I thought about presenting my story to my classmates in Telling Stories with Data, I realized that the class and Heinz College as a whole represent a much sought-after demographic in theatre and the arts; well-educated younger adults with an interest in either public policy, the arts, or information systems. So while my intended audience is actually the class, in a way they also represent a larger population of potential arts audiences that I am trying to entice with my story. 

Using the class as a frame of reference, I have made some general assumptions about my audience. My audience is: 
* Age 22-35
* Pursuing a Master's Degree or higher
* Living in a smaller urban center with a rich arts and cultural district
* Interested in Public Policy (approx 60%) Arts Management (approx 20%) or Information Systems (approx 20%) 
* Above the poverty line, with some expendable income and large potential for expendable income in just a few years after graduation

### Selecting Test Users

My selection of test users was informed by my intended audience parameters and a level of convenience. I selected three test users who I thought brought a variety of viewpoints to my work. They are:

1. **My Roommate** 
An Arts Management master's student with a background in orchestral music. She is familiar with non-profit arts organizations but not necessarily with theatre. I felt that her viewpoint, though closest to my own, would be valuable to me to make sure that my story is still compelling for someone who does come to the table with a bit more knowledge about the subject matter. 

2. **My girlfriend**
A MEIM student currently living in LA. Her background is in the music industry. I thought she could provide a more commercial point of view and let me know if the non-profit sections in particular were too niche or had any jargon. 

3. **My Sister**
An administrative assistant planning to pursue a Master's or PhD in microbiology. Though she is not currently enrolled in school, my sister is very well-educated and has a scientific background, which I thought would bring a more analytical viewpoint to my visualizations. 

### User Feedback Survey

I asked each test user to look through my wireframes and storyboard and answer some questions about each of the major visualizations, plus a few questions about the overall flow of the story. The questions are below: 
###### Please answer for each of the visualizations
1. In your own words, please use 1-2 sentences to state what you think the main message of this visualization is. 
2. Please rate the visualization on each of the following elements using the scale below:

| 1-Very Bad | 2-Poor | 3-Fair | 4-Good | 5- Excellent |

  a.	Aesthetics- is it nice to look at?
  
  b.	Mood- do the colors and fonts suit the message?
  
  c.	Clarity- how easy is it to navigate and understand?
  
  d.	Completeness- does it seem like there’s information missing?
  
  e.	Intrigue- does it tell a story that interests you? 
  
3.	Please list any suggestions you have, or specific problem areas you’d like to see addressed:

###### Please answer for the overall story
1.	Do you think there is a story inherent in the way the data is presented? 
2.	If so, is the story easy to follow? 
3.	Do you have any other notes or recommendations about the overall flow of the piece?

* You have to scroll across to see everything. It would be better if its all together in one frame. 
* The legend is hidden away on the right. It should be the first thing you see.

* The world of nonprofit theatre is so huge. This needs to clarify what it includes: what types of theatres? How big?
* Might be interesting to see side by side with Broadway to show our attendance is not rising as quickly. 
* This one is less colorful and interesting to look at than the previous ones.
##### Viz #4
* Nonprofit theatres over time. Overall it has increased. when you scroll over it it even tells you contributed vs earned. 
* Aesthetics: 4

Clarity: 3.5
Completeness: 3.5
Intrigue: 4
* It might be interesting to have different colors for Broadway and Nonprofit? Or for Revenue and Attendance. It depends how you frame it. If you do a side by side comparison, they should be different colors. 
##### Overall 
* Yes. I think the story is that Broadway and theatre are not dying artforms, they actually have experienced great increases in attendance and revenue over the last several decades. 
* Yes. I think the information presented is clear and understandable. 
* No further comments.

*  I would maybe color code overall broadway separately from non profit. And coordinate the corresponding visualizations. Also why does this graph have a gross vs. adjusted revenue like the first one?

### Conclusions from User Feedback
The major conclusion that I drew from the user feedback is that I can lean in more to comparing Broadway and Nonprofit theatre. This is one of those conclusions that seems so obvious from the outside, but was almost impossible for me to see from my position as a nonprofit theatre practitioner. 

It's been interesting to see how this story has evolved for me. I started out with just the Broadway data, and I figured I would tell a story about how theatre is doing pretty well, despite what you may have heard. But as I started to view it through the lens of storytelling, I realized that the message I want to send to audiences is not "the industry is fine, don't worry about us." I decided to add in the nonprofit information to make the story more personal, and end with an inspiring call to action to empower my audience to take part in their local arts organizations. 

Even then, I was hesitant to directly compare the success of Broadway with regional nonprofit theatre,  because to me they are completely separate entities. But to a more general audience, they are two parts of the same industry. I can see now how I can use this to my advantage. 

The audience attendance rates show that more and more people are attending theatre, both on Broadway and regionally. I can show through the data that while region theatre is serving a much wider audience, it is not seeing the same growth in revenues as Broadway. I can then use this information to encourage my audience to support local theatre as patrons and donors.
