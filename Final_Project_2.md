# Final Project

## Part Two: Wireframes and User Research

I started out by drafting wireframe versions of the major components of my data story in Tableau. I then compiled them into a new page in my github portfolio, so that my test users could access them. I found this to be a relatively simple solution that achieved the "scrolling story" design I am aiming for in my final project.
