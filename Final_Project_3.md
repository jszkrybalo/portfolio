# Final Project
## Part Three: Final Deliverable

### Intended Audience
My intended audience for the final presentation and the final data story is essentially the same as when I first conceived of the story, which is adults aged 22-35 living in a smaller urban area and pursuing higher education, with an interest in arts, policy, or information systems. I catered my call to action a bit more specifically to Pittsburgh and CMU students since I felt that would have more impact, particularly in the presentation. 

I learned quite a bit about my intended audience through the user feedback and the in-class review session. Specifically, I learned that I would need to better define the difference between Broadway/commercial theatre and not-for-profit theatre companies. Even for my test user who was a fellow arts management student, this distinction needed to be more clearly delineated. I did my best in my final story to make these definitions clear without talking down to my audience or obfuscating the message with too many details. I did keep one key point as a general knowledge assumption. Though I considered explaining it further, I decided that the core idea that live theatre might be struggling to remain relevant in the modern world is likely common knowledge among my intended audience. I did include a very brief section to flesh out the core question, more to serve as an introduction than an explanation.

Also in considering my intended audience, I aimed to keep my visualizations and the final story as clean and simple as possible.
