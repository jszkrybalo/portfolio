### Final Data Story

### Intended Audience
My intended audience for the final presentation and the final data story is essentially the same as when I first conceived of the story, which is adults aged 22-35 living in a smaller urban area and pursuing higher education, with an interest in arts, policy, or information systems. I catered my call to action a bit more specifically to Pittsburgh and CMU students since I felt that would have more impact, particularly in the presentation. 

I learned quite a bit about my intended audience through the user feedback and the in-class review session. Specifically, I learned that I would need to better define the difference between Broadway/commercial theatre and not-for-profit theatre companies. Even for my test user who was a fellow arts management student, this distinction needed to be more clearly delineated. I did my best in my final story to make these definitions clear without talking down to my audience or obfuscating the message with too many details. I did keep one key point as a general knowledge assumption. Though I considered explaining it further, I decided that the core idea that live theatre might be struggling to remain relevant in the modern world is likely common knowledge among my intended audience. I did include a very brief section to flesh out the core question, more to serve as an introduction than an explanation.

Also in consideration of my intended audience, I aimed to keep my visualizations and the final story as clean and simple as possible. I tried to keep explanations very brief. My theory behind this choice was that a reader with average or below average interest in my topic may be dissuaded from reading long paragraphs of text. However, I also made sure that my visualizations were interactive so that a reader with above average interest in the topic could easily dive deeper into the information presented and draw their own conclusions. 

### Developing the Story 
Throughout the process, the story I wanted to tell developed pretty organically as I interacted with the data and received feedback from peers. I discussed in Part Two how I began with just the Broadway grosses dataset and expanded to include information about non-profit regional theatre. Once I compared the two datasets and received some initial feedback, I really felt that the most important story to tell was about how local non-profit theatre can reach a much wider audience than Broadway, but requires more support and funding from the public to keep it alive and thriving. 

As a result of this shift in my story, there are several elements in my initial sketches that did not make the final cut in the story. Most notably, I cut the section where I had planned to show the "dark side" of Broadway with information and statistics about how risky commercial theatre can be. I would have liked to explore that angle, but I didn't think it tied in with my final story enough to justify including it. 

I compiled much more data than I ended up including, but I found through investigation that most of it did not add any additional value to the core story I was telling. If I were to return to this project and develop it even further, I might consider creative ways I could include more of the data into the story, for those readers who would like to explore more information. But for the purposes of this project, I am pleased with how I consolidated information to tell one clear story. 

### Developing the Visualizations
You can see through my process from sketched to wireframes to final that I changed my mind about chart types several times. I decided early on in creating the wireframes that I wanted to separate revenue and attendance, even though I initially imagined showing them on the same chart. While I experimented with combining them into one chart, I found that it was much more difficult to create something that was easily understandable. I wanted each of my charts to give the reader a basic understanding at first glance, keeping with my goal to maximize ease of use. 

When I chose to separate revenue and attendance, I decided that I wanted to give each a distinct chart type, so they would be easily distinguishable. In my wireframes, I presented the revenue as a bar chart and attendance as a line graph. However, after considering it more, I decided that line graphs were more often associated with sales and revenues, which is why I made the change in the final version. 

I will admit that I struggled with color, which I think was my fault in that I saved color choice until the very end, making it my final step. As a result, I am not thrilled with my color choices and wish I had spect more time on them. But my thought process was: 
* I wanted the Broadway graphs to have a more electric, bright aesthetic and the non-profit graphs to have a more subdued, gentle palette.
* I wanted the revenue lines to be green or close to green, since that color is often associated with money. 
* I wanted the "adjusted for inflation" lines to be grey, since they represented more of a concept than hard data.

Lastly, I do wish I had found a way to create the bubble callouts representing popular (or infamous) Broadway shows on the attendance graph. Unfortunately this was a bit above my skill level and while I tried a few options, nothing worked as well as I had envisioned.
