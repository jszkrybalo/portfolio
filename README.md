Public Portfolio for Telling Stories With Data Fall 2019 Mini 2

# About Me
My name is Jacelyn Szkrybalo. My pronouns are she/her. I am a second year Masters of Arts Management student at Heinz College. 

My background is in theatre, specifically production and company management. I came to graduate school because my ultimate goal is to manage a theatre company and I wanted to learn more skills and best practices to help me achieve that goal. I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of Connecticut with a major in Theatre Studies and a minor in Business Fundamentals. I have three years of post-grad work experience ranging from assistantships at regional theatre companies to accounting work for a condo management firm. 

# What I Hope To Learn
I would like to leave this class with a better understanding of design principles. I have very rudimentary knowledge of design, but I would like to feel more comfortable discussing and critiquing design. 

Furthermore, I would like to learn best practices for creating data visualizations that are simple and easy to read. I see this coming in to play in my future career in the form of annual reports and board reports. I want to be able to convey information about my company's financial health and the success of our programming in visualizations that make sense to my reader, carefully determining what information is important to include and what information can be left out.
